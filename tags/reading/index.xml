      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love books, and I try to devote as much time as possible to reading.
That time for me is usually in the evening, before going to sleep.
However, I try to sneak some reading between the myriad of daily activities as well.
That helps to progress steadily among the several books that I usually read at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the way books trigger the brain. A book makes you travel instantly without actually leaving the sofa.
It applies equally to books that talk about geography as well as to science and technology.
Books are teachers and companions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning I thought to use this space to keep track of the book I have read, but I found more convenient to use an app such as [Goodreads] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/)&#34;&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/)&lt;/a&gt;.
Instead, here I am going to write short reviews and summary of the main ideas of some selected books.&lt;/p&gt;

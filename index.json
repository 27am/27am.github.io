The gold of the 21st century is not made of atoms but bits. Old terms acquire new meanings, while society steadily walks towards post-modernism.\nThe term mining might evoke ancient times images: gold diggers of the 19th centuries rushing to be the first one to discover a gold vein, or in more recent times it might remind you of the pixellated word of Minecraft (and dozens similar).\nIn Bitcoin, mining is not performed by digging a hole with a shovel but instead by computing cryptographic hash functions as quickly as possible in order to find our gold: the solution to a crypto puzzle. The output of a hash function is called digest, and for us to be valid it must belong to a limited set of solution whose value has to be lower than an adjustable threshold, i.e. it should, at least in the case of Bitcoin, begin with a certain number of leading zeros. The solution for this cryptographic puzzle is a scarce resource (exactly like diamonds) which makes it valuable. That’s the ingenious trick devised to give Bitcoin an economical value while remaining just a sequence of bits in somebody’s hard drive. It emulates in a digital environment the pile of gold that has been hardly and over time accumulated in a bank’s vault.\nThat’s not the only possible type of Proof. In general, in order to be a viable mining technique, it should satisfy some properties:\nBe easy to verify, although moderately difficult to calculate The effort to find a solution should be adjustable The chance to find a solution should be proportional to the resources spent in mining, preventing one single miner to always win the race just because it’s the fastest. This property is called progress-free, memoryless or stateless.\nUsing mining techniques limits consistently the impact of Sybil attacks while giving a way to reach a consensus through the simple rule of expanding the longest chain. Indeed, without mining, any malicious actor would be able to destroy the system by creating fake identities. It’s still possible to subvert the system by owning large part of it, namely 51%, but it would be highly costly and, since it would destroy the trust and the profitability of the system right afterwards, it’s considered totally irrational from an economic point of view. This is linked to the concept of Nash equilibrium, where each stakeholder has the interest of following the rules of the system.\nFor more details, Bitcoin mining the hard way is truly a gold mine.\nReferences [1] Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies - Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten, Andrew Miller, Steven Goldfeder\n[2] Bitcoin and Beyond: A Technical Survey on Decentralized Digital Currencies - Florian Tschorsch, Björn Scheuerman\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549324800,"objectID":"385553fc8dd72ac77a27963f70d0a734","permalink":"https://27am.github.io/post/blockchain/mining-in-bitcoin/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/blockchain/mining-in-bitcoin/","section":"post","summary":"Summary. The gold of the 21st century is not made of atoms but bits. Old terms acquire new meanings, while society steadily walks towards post-modernism.\nThe term mining might evoke ancient times images: gold diggers of the 19th centuries rushing to be the first one to discover a gold vein, or in more recent times it might remind you of the pixellated word of Minecraft (and dozens similar).\nIn Bitcoin, mining is not performed by digging a hole with a shovel but instead by computing cryptographic hash functions as quickly as possible in order to find our gold: the solution to a crypto puzzle.","tags":["technology","blockchain"],"title":"Mining in Bitcoin","type":"post"},{"authors":["Andrea Merlina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1487600100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487600100,"objectID":"78bdb9d9d2aee36b6ac8234a899aec64","permalink":"https://27am.github.io/talk/enose/","publishdate":"2017-02-20T14:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/enose/","section":"talk","summary":"Data analysis on lung cancer based on patient's breath.","tags":["machine learning","lung","cancer","detection","matlab"],"title":"Electronic nose for lung cancer detection","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The paper can be found here. and discusses a system to build management tools based on gossip protocols.\nIn general, gossip protocols are characterized by randomized peer selection and periodic communication, which makes them extremely fault tolerant since there is no realiance on a single path.\nMiCa allows to compose several different gossip protocols and to run them independently\nA protocols is defined by a tuple containing:\nNode\u0026rsquo;s states Rate of gossiping View: A probability mass distribution to sample the peers update of state The framework supports different typs of composition\nIndependence preserving Correlated: the gossip subprotocols are exectuted together as often as possible while presering the probability distributiond and the Rate An example of composition is to first create a tree overlay, executed a broadcast opeation to the leaf nodes of the overlay and then aggregate the result back to the overlay root, i.e. a node acting as a leader.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c405f6c72ffc10a1182afaff5ccdab67","permalink":"https://27am.github.io/post/papers/mica/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/papers/mica/","section":"post","summary":"The paper can be found here. and discusses a system to build management tools based on gossip protocols.\nIn general, gossip protocols are characterized by randomized peer selection and periodic communication, which makes them extremely fault tolerant since there is no realiance on a single path.\nMiCa allows to compose several different gossip protocols and to run them independently\nA protocols is defined by a tuple containing:\nNode\u0026rsquo;s states Rate of gossiping View: A probability mass distribution to sample the peers update of state The framework supports different typs of composition","tags":null,"title":"MiCa: A Compositional Architecture for Gossip Protocols","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a small story about having a \u0026ldquo;programming hat\u0026rdquo; in your closet ready to be worn.\nI like math and I have great respect for every profession that involves it.

Programming should be taught starting from the first year of college so to give every student the time to crystallize concepts and improve. I find this true also for inherently speculative and less practical subjects like mathematics and physics, especially the way they are taught in Italy. I always had passion for practical activity and programming gives you the power to actually create something that wasn\u0026rsquo;t existing before, pretty much as craftsmanship or gardening.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9d4c902e029f9df9cdbaf52534dd6a84","permalink":"https://27am.github.io/post/2018-08-21-the-benefits-of-programming/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-08-21-the-benefits-of-programming/","section":"post","summary":"This is a small story about having a \u0026ldquo;programming hat\u0026rdquo; in your closet ready to be worn.\nI like math and I have great respect for every profession that involves it.
